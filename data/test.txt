Some Notes (As well a Huffman Test File):

Huffman encoding test to verify the compression/encoding of data.
As well as verify the decompression/decoding of the encoded data.
Go go gopher.
For huffman to be effective, the data to be encoded must contain many 
bytes of information, since the encoding must contain the magic hex number,
information for decoding the data and the data itself.
If the original text is too small, there will be almost no benifit/improvements.
But for data that's large, it helps out a lot.
